## Prospective group members

Research in the Ocean and Climate Data Science lab adresses questions about ocean and climate change by implementing and developing novel statistical and machine learning methodologies. We are always looking for motivated students and collaborators to join the group. 


### Prospective undergraduate students

If you are an undergraduate student at UCSC and interested in getting some research experience, you can send an email to Claudie with a description of your research interests and your CV. There may be opportunities for summer research internships and/or project supervision through paid internships or independent studies credits. Sources of funding include the [Undergraduate Research in Science and Technology Awards](https://science.ucsc.edu/research-opportunities/undergraduate-research-in-science-and-technology/) and the [Koret Scholars Program](https://undergradresearch.ucsc.edu/ugr/koret-scholars-program/). Undergraduate students in the lab typically take Data Analysis in the Environmental Sciences (ESCI160) and Applied Environmental Time Series Analysis (ESCI167) (see [Claudie's teaching page](https://claudiebeaulieu.github.io/teaching/)) to get up to speed with the statistical background and R programming skills needed to do research in the lab. Other classes undergraduate researchers in the lab often take that are highly recommended include Introduction to Scientific Programming (EART 119A) and Advanced Scientific Programming (EART 119B).

### Prospective graduate students

If you are a student with strong quantitative skills looking to obtain a [PhD/MS degree in Ocean Sciences](https://ocean.ucsc.edu/), this may be the lab for you. Research in the lab is computational, we analyze a suite of observational datasets and outputs from model simulations. Experience with R and/or Python are highly desirable. In addition to the Ocean Sciences degree, it is also possible to obtain a [Designated Emphasis in Data Science](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/en/current/general-catalog/academic-units/baskin-engineering/statistics/data-science-designated-emphasis). If you are interested in joining the group, you can send an email to Claudie with a description of your background, research interests and goals for entering a graduate program. Application guidelines are also detailed [here](https://science.ucsc.edu/degree/ocean-sciences/).

### Prospective postdoctoral researchers

Please reach out if you are interested in applying to postdoctoral fellowships to join our lab with a description of your background, research interests and goals for your postdoctoral research. Potential postdoctoral fellowships include the [University of California Presidentâ€™s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/), the [NOAA Climate & Global Change Program](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc) and [NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/postdocs). Research in our lab is interdisciplinary by nature, and there may be opportunities via the [Schmidt Science Fellows](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) program.
