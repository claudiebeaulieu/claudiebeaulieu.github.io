## Prospective group members

Research in the Ocean and Climate Data Science lab adresses questions about ocean and climate change by implementing and developing novel statistical and machine learning methodologies. We are always looking for motivated students and collaborators to join our group.

### Prospective undergraduate students

If you are an undergraduate student at UCSC and interested in getting some research experience, you can send an email to Claudie with a description of your research interests and your CV. There may be opportunities for summer research internships and/or project supervision through the [Undergraduate Research in Science and Technology Awards](https://science.ucsc.edu/research-opportunities/undergraduate-research-in-science-and-technology/) and the [Koret Scholars Program](https://undergradresearch.ucsc.edu/ugr/koret-scholars-program/).

### Prospective graduate students

If you are a student with strong quantitative skills looking to obtain a [PhD/MS degree in Ocean Sciences](https://ocean.ucsc.edu/), this may be the lab for you. Experience with R and/or Python are highly desirable. In addition to the ocean sciences degree, it is also possible to obtain a [Designated Emphasis in Data Science](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/en/current/general-catalog/academic-units/baskin-engineering/statistics/data-science-designated-emphasis). If you are interested in joining the group, you can send an email to Claudie with a description of your background, research interests and goals for entering a graduate program. Application guidelines are also detailed [here](https://science.ucsc.edu/degree/ocean-sciences/).

### Prospective postdoctoral researchers

Please reach out if you are interested in applying to postdoctoral fellowships to join our lab with a description of your background, research interests and goals for your postdoctoral research. Potential postdoctoral fellowships include the [University of California Presidentâ€™s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/), the [NOAA Climate & Global Change Program](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc) and [NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/postdocs).
