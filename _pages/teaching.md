The overall goal of my teaching is to equip the next generation of environmental sciences students with data science skills. I teach at all levels, from large lower division introductory classes to small graduate level specialized classes. All my classes use the R programming language. Below, you fill find a list of classes I teach on a regular basis at UCSC, with link to syllabus.

* Data Analysis in the Environmental Sciences (ESCI160) [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cs17_YGPhIm522IngPZLk7j_eenFURx2/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102873059145395016647&rtpof=true&sd=true)

    * The main aim of this course is to introduce data analysis methods regularly encountered within environmental sciences. You will learn how to think about data, its uncertainty, how models and data are related and depend on underlying assumptions, and how to synthesize information contained in data. The class will focus on two main areas of study: 1) environmental sampling and risk analysis and 2) climate and environmental change detection.  This class satisfies the Statistical Reasoning (SR) General Education requirement. 


* Applied Environmental Time Series Analysis (ESCI167/OCEA267)

* Fundamentals of Climate (OCEA90)

* Capstone seminar (ESCI 191)
