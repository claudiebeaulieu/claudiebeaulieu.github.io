We are a research group affiliated with the [Ocean Sciences department](https://ocean.ucsc.edu/) at the [University of California Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). We bridge the gap between ocean and climate sciences, and data science.

Recent advances in climate and ocean monitoring, observational platforms, measurement techniques, and Earth System models contribute to a rapid increase in quality and quantity of available data. Our efforts are based on a range of interdisciplinary approaches that implement statistics and data science to make best use of observations and outputs from model simulations. We aim to better quantify and understand natural variability and change, and impacts on humans and ecosystems.
